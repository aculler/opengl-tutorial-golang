# opengl-tutorial-golang

The goal of this repo is to re-build each of the tutorials from opengl-tutorial.org using Go. This is mostly for my own learning experience, but I'm planning to push the code here along with a readme for each tutorial that walks through the parts of the code. Each tutorial will live in a subdirectory and the readme for that tutorial will be linked from here.

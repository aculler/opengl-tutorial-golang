# opengl-tutorial-golang

The goal of this repo is to re-build each of the tutorials from [opengl-tutorial.org](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org) using Go. This is mostly for my own learning experience, but I'm planning to push the code here along with a readme for each tutorial that walks through the parts of the code. Each tutorial will live in a subdirectory and the readme for that tutorial will be linked from here.

**A note for Windows users:** Getting go-gl installed on Windows can be a major headache, however what I've found to work is using the [MinGW-64](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php) project. The website doesn't use SSL, hosts on SourceForge, and seems a bit sketchy, but so far as I can tell it is legit and the only/best option for 64-bit Windows.
